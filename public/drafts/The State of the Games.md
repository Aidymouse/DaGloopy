I've been rolling dice, Creatures.

A long time ago I wrote an article called [A Worldwide RPG]().

At that time, I had a deep love for sandbox RPG gaming, but I hadn't actually done it yet. It was all idealism.

We did do a playtest of this game - one session.

The link between setting and rules.

The rules now really represent the kind of game I want to play. And what kind of setting I want my setting to be. And I find myself torn between some irreconcilable differences.

Magic system

A free-form system that enforces rules that allows for dungeon crawling while keep risk real.

I've been toying with Get Smashed RPG, which has a more light feel to it that

I'm really torn between a serious, dark setting and the levity found in old school D&D. The rulebook presents both, but you don't really get both when you sit down to play. I don't want a game about short circuiting the intended challenges, but how do you expand on them while retaining fun?

## What does my ideal dungeon crawling loop look like?

Venture into dungeon - gain some injuries - gain some treasure - recover during downtime - venture forward again.

- I'd like for about 20 rooms to be clearable before you absolutely have to go back to town.

- I want injuries to be concrete things. But you get a lot of flexibility from hit points.

- I want fights to have long consequences, but also players are hardy enough to not be dying instantly. However, I want a small chance this happens due to bad luck / poor planning.

- I want dramatic combat where the action in the moment matters more than who's turn it is. I want it to be fast, dynamic and exciting. I want threats to be very real.

- I want player skill to matter more, and let everyone try everything like knave, but domain knowledge is a very important part of differentiating characters. I don't know if I want a skill system, but you should definitely be rewarded for have specific knowledge as your character.

- Maybe not everyone needs to have infinite things to do during a 

- Characters in this game fulfill two roles:
    1. A place in the world. For the roleplay and the story of the game they must know their place in it.
    2. A role in the dungeon crawl gameplay loop. This is much harder, cos you need to be important, but you could be missing entirely.
