# 12 Room Dungeon Blocks
Recently came across this really rad post by Whose Measure God Could Not Take that talks about [20-block dungeon keying](https://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2023/03/20-block-dungeon-stocking.html). It's really good, really cool, dudes got a crazy good grasp of what makes dungeons good ([and D&D style games in general](https://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2021/03/the-school-of-evocation-conveying.html)).

Except I'm lazy, and 20 rooms is too many. 12 seems more my number. I think I can come up with 6 decent ideas for dungeon rooms before I get bored, and 12 is just two sixes.

Go read the article for the good stuff, but if you want the math for what should be in each room:
- 2x creature
- 2x creature with treasure
- 2x special
- 3x empty
- 1x hidden treasure
- 1x trap
- 1x trap with treasure

Now, a dungeon with 12 rooms means the space is small. Keep that in mind when stocking encounters - there isn't really room for deep dark hidden things. The inhabitants of the dungeon probably know about each other.

However, you could stick two blocks together - 24 rooms. Hey, we're back to the OG article :P
