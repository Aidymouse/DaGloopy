# Mausritter Style Domain Level Play

salutations creatures of the world

off the back of my last blog thing about mausritter and birthright i went back to [Sunless Realms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18cPVHgkpuLHLyvWrhkpq7S28oq2nn4LTQZD0M7UBjOw/edit), an old setting of mine (well, I stole it from a friend), intent to build a new region using the cool nobility sensibilities i got from birthright.

And in crafting this region at some point i had to sit down and codify my domain system.

It's basically mausritters faction system+. Instead of resources you have provinces that have holdings, and there are some more refined rules for warfare in there. There's also a sample region which i'm pretty proud of, has some neat play potential I think.

You can get the rules here but i will also briefly describe it now:

## Mausritter Style Domain Level Play

_And I do mean Mausritter style. The PDF even uses the same fonts!_

A domain is made up of provinces. Provinces have holdings. Holdings are the domains resources. Domains also have goals, just like factions.

Time is split into domain turns (2 weeks by default, but you can change them). Each domain turn plays basically like this:

 - Random Event
 -  Taxes and Upkeep
 -  Goal Progression
 -  Warfare (if at war)

There's a table for random events. They provide inspiration for adventures or obstacles for the ruler of the domain.

The ruler gets money (1p per citizen) but has to spend it to maintain their strongholds and armies.

The domain gets a roll for goals just like a faction does.

Warfare encompasses raising units, moving them, skirmishes, battles, sieges. just like my [last article](https://dagloopyrpg.blot.im/birthright-mausritter-rules-light-warfare).

Go read the [PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1meP5FXoW2nFU02uKrfKMMaPuF2A_bpti/view?usp=sharing), i think it turned out pretty cool. Works best as spreads.

I might do an article or another pdf on how to go about putting together a domain. The short version is: make a map, place some settlements, create leaders, roll some random events to craft history, think logically, make it tangled.

Enjoy it creatures. more to come
