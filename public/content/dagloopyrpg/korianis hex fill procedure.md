# Korianis Hex Fill Procedure

Rise by the will of your warlord, creatures.

Korianis is one of the regions in my never-finished Sunless Realms RPG.

Korianis is a land of feudal kingdoms. Barons, dukes, earls. Knights, oaths, dragons. Once united by an emperor, when Tasozek the Insurmountable extinguished the sun his arcano-lords executed the emperor and all his kings, throwing the great kingdoms into disarray.

Now the land is a patchwork mess of broken kingdoms, monster baronies, forgotten castles and ambitious warlords. Villages are secluded, distant. The wilderness, dangerous and crawling with monsters. 

These tables are based on Luke Gearings excellent [Wolves Upon the Coast Hex Fill Procedure](https://lukegearing.blot.im/wolves-upon-the-coast-hexfill-procedure) and [Wilderness Hexplore](https://pdfcoffee.com/wilderness-hexplore-revised-pdf-free.html), condensed Judges guild rules wilderness generation rules.


### Playtest Update
I used these rules in my last three sessions, on the fly, to stock some hexes. In short, they aren't as good as gearings hex fills. They don't do an awfully good job of creating gameable stuff (at least for the kind of game I'm running) and are a bit too strict to allow for the creative flexibility compared to Gearings tables. Maybe it's just me, but my mind goes completely blank when I roll up a castle with a 4th level fighter leader. What does this mean at the table? Worked for Gary. Doesn't for me.

**Addendum:** The major reason for the failing of this rule is because the tables say nothing about how a castle encounter is meant to go. As such, the information they provide is useless. However, the AD&D DMG provides some real guidance on this. A friendly reaction is one where the host is hospitable and friendly, entertaining their guests. A neutral reaction will turn guests away unless they win against some from of non-lethal combat (confiscating armor or weapons on loss), a hostile one is either outright attack or feigning friendliness then attacking when they are drunk! I'm going to talk about this more shortly.

## Lair
Place monsters and treasure as you will (perhaps using the [one-roll varied treasure hoard generator](https://dagloopyrpg.blot.im/one-roll-varied-treasure-hoard)?)

## Temple / Shrine
Temples are places of worship. Shrines are places where religious activities are performed.

| 1-4 | Shrine |
| 5-6 | Temple |

| d6 | Temple Alignment |
|---|---|
| 1-3 | Lawful Saint |

**Temples**

| 4-5 | Abbey | 3d6 x 10 + 25% chance for a level-d6 cleric leader |
| 6 | Compound | d10 x 100 + level-d10 cleric leader |

**Shrines**

## Castles
Countless castles dot Korianis from times immemorial. On anything other than a positive reaction, if the characters are spotted by the castle inhabitants (3-in-6 in castles hex), the ruler of the castle will ride out to meet them, demanding the tithe. If it isn't met, they will either attack or chase intruders out of their domain.
