# Blog Posts I like

 - [Syncretic D&D, Or, the Shoe That Does Not Drop](http://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.com/2023/12/syncretic-d-or-shoe-that-does-not-drop.html) (Monsters and Manuals, 2023) talks about AD&Ds christian-ness and how that fits into a game where other gods exist, not just in fiction but christian values are inherent to the text.

 - [Wolves Upon the Cost Hexfill Procedure](https://lukegearing.blot.im/wolves-upon-the-coast-hexfill-procedure) is a post I can't shut up about. Simple, elegant, intensely gameable. Gearing is a genius.

 - [20-Block Dungeon Stocking](https://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2023/03/20-block-dungeon-stocking.html) solidified in my head the way a dungeon inhabits a living world, aiding both wilderness and city play.

 - [Conveying compelling and complete worlds through implication](https://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2021/03/the-school-of-evocation-conveying.html) solidifies my thinking about why I prefer the old schools descriptive action over checks (e.g. "how do you disarm the poison dart" rather than "give me a thieves tools check")

 - [Dungeon Room Index: Hallways](https://dungeonscrawler.blogspot.com/2025/02/dungeon-room-index-hallways.html) is a wonderful exploration of hallways. Gets me thinking about the dungeon in a more concrete way, full of great examples and drawings.
