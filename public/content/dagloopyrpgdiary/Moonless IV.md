# Moonless IV

The remaining kobolds take one of the prisoners before they're slain. After Benry turns back from an anvil, it's discovered that the remaining passage leads back to the kitchen. Every branch has been explored, and the dragons key is yet to be found.

Every passage but one.

The ogre lives beyond the fallen bridge. It's found grey and lifeless, clutching at its stomach, a pile of bones in the corner of its cave. It's been dead for some time. The key is fastened in a loop around its neck.

The dragon, Sareesees, is in the debt of the dwarves who freed it.

"If you ever need it, just call upon me. You would be surprised the worlds I can travel to."

As it departs to the sky, the ragtag dwarves depart from the cave. They leave behind the corpses of innumerable fallen. Hopefully the prisoners can find peace.

But before that, they have to get back to town.

No warmth, no food, no idea of where they are, missing limbs and companions, the dwarves find themselves trekking aimlessly through the wilderness. In the distance, a plume of smoke is seen. A distant campfire. The dwarves wonder if they should approach. They have little choice.

The camp holds several wagons with extravagant silks. A central campfire surrounded by humans dressed in all kinds of colors. They smoke meat while one strums a lute gently. They quiet as the dwarves approach.

"Ah... the four dwarves. Our master, Madam Eva, has been expecting you."

The dwarves react with suitable apprehension, but they promise of food and shelter drives insecurity from their mind. They agree to meet with this enigmatic master, if only to find out how she knows about them.

In the morning a deep fog has rolled in, and the carts depart through the gloomy wood. The strange travellers describe their master as the lord of the darkness, seemingly immune to the forces that plague the night. Though a year is no short time, it is not long enough for an empire to have been born in the time the dwarves were slaves of the kobolds. The carts do not travel far enough to reach even Ilmere, but the journey terminates.

The dwarves are deposited in a strange land. The travellers inform them to take the right fork at the road beyond the nearby town, then depart into the fog. The decrepit sign reads "BAROVIA" in faded letters.

There is no one in town. It's dark, but not quiet. A sobbing woman can be heard from one of the broken houses. The dwarves exchange grim looks, and head towards the general store. The shopkeep charges far too high a price, but the dwarves have gold, not food. Sharing in their spoils, the dwarves head north up the road.

They follow the right fork in the road as instructed, and eventually come across a larger camp with wagons similar to the ones they arrived in. The people there point them in the direction of Madam Eva, in a large silk tent.

Madam Eva sits in a cloud of incense and smoke. She sits at a flat table shuffling a deck of well worn cards. She opens her eyes and studies the dwarves inquisitively. The bemused dwarves are beckoned to sit at the table.

"I have long awaited your arrival. You see, this land of Barovia is controlled by a ruthless tyrant. Some call him a devil. His name is Strahd von Zarovich and he is count of these lands. It is your destiny to destroy this man and save these lands. At least... you must if you wish ever to return home."

The dwarves protest, and bark questions. Why would destiny choose these four prisoners to save a land they have never heard of?

"The cards will reveal much, my friends." says Madam Eva as she begins to lay out cards on the table. "You will find that Barovia, in it's bleakness, is not without aid for those that would seek it."

"This card tells of history, an ancient mystery which you would do well to understand. The Monk tells us the answer lies behind the sun in the house of a saint."

"This card tells of a force for good, a holy symbol that may undo the devils work. The Bishop tells of a pile of treasure hidden beyond amber doors."

"This card tells of power and strength. A weapon to defeat evil. A sword of sunlight. The Healer tells us to the look west, for a pool blessed by the light of a white sun."

"This card tells of an ally who may aid you should you succeed in courting their favor. The Beast signifies a werewolf with a deep hatred of Strahd."

"This card tells your of your enemy. Cloaked behind shadow and spite. The lord of these accursed lands. The Broken One knows that the devil haunts the tomb of a man he hates above all."

The dwarves have many questions, but Madam Eva cannot know more than her cards can tell. She can tell only of the nearby villages that will serve as respite during the quest.

She tells the dwarves one more thing just before they leave.

"Strahds worst enemy... is himself."
