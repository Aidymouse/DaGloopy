# Ruby Crown III and IV

Clement led the frog army deeper into the kobolds cave. Finding a massive chamber full of men, women and children kobolds, Clement did not stop the frogs when they leapt forward to the slaughter. The party did not stick around to see the results of the battle.

It is the depths of midnight when they reach the gates of Fangmire, having forgone a rest to press on further. Not but a few yards from the gate, the sky fills with a dazzling light. Above them, a shooting star, aflame, rockets through the air, crashing into the swamp and sliding to a steaming stop. Emerging from the crater is a perfectly unscathed naked man.

He is questioned for a short time (it is revealed he is named Balthazar) before clothed and brought into the town under the wing of the party, who shield him from the guards questions.

They rest for a week to level up, then returns to get the treasure they buried in the beast man’s camp. At the webbed crossing they decide this time to burn the webs and evict the spiders. The battle is close, but they win. After retrieving their treasure they rest for another week.

During this time a black knight comes to town. He is Sir Valamo, who is looking for the “heroes” that destroyed the beastmans camp. He speaks slow and is a little off putting to the characters. He leaves shortly thereafter. The party keeps him in the back of their minds.

The gang journeys southeast to Encathra, a larger town on the south of the Llamontca Wode, overseer of the forest and seat of the baron Aeon. They are here to meet Nimdok, the arcanist of hourglass tower, who hopefully can restore Clements hand.

They score an audience with the presence of their elf. Nimdok wishes to study the elf, and promises a commendation to the royal academy of Sorcerers in Solemnity if he agrees. He also promises the help Clement if they can retrieve the head of the lion-bodied enchantress in a cave nearby. They agree to both.

On the way to the cave the party encounters Zaeiram, a green dragon covered in jewels, gems and necklaces. Luckily, she is hidden under a pile of earth, dozing after having gorged herself, so she does not try to eat them. Lobsang shows her enough reverence that she does not feel the need to put them in their place. She warns them not to intrude on her giant tree lair to the northwest. They agree.

There are 7 enchanted woodsmen outside the cave of the lion bodied enchantress. Balthazar lures them away with his locket that can roar like a lion, and they enter the cave. At first the enchantress feigns innocence, but she reveals her mind altering powers in an attempt to get Gruffie mayhem to drown herself. In the ensuing melee, the enchantress tries to call for her woodsmen, but she is cut down just as they arrive and the spell is broken. The woodsmen collapse in exhaustion and hunger, and they spend the night in the cave.

They return to Encathra, the woodsmen finding their way to their hamlets and wives. Nimdok makes good on his promise and, after much experimentation, casts a seeing spell that allows him to remove the ring from Clements finger. They spend the rest of the month carousing and relaxing in the town of bells, before setting off for Solemnity, chasing other rumours of a knights enchanted plate armor and magic cliff of pondak bluff.

But they never arrive. A regiment of armoured knights led by Sir Valamo arrest them on the road in the name of Baron Tayan-Rodo-Voghtairi. The party comes peacefully with a desire to understand why they have been acosted this way.

On the long travel south they meet Temenoax, a denizen of the city of brass of the fire plane, who is searching for his unicorn servant.

Finally they arrive at New Ornos, capital and stronghold of the sorcerer baron. It is wrought of iron spikes, built into the rock of the mountain. Chanting and wailing can be heard. Stray animals frequently have warped forms - third eyes, 5 legs, two tails.

The party is escorted to the the spiked keep and the sorcerer barons chamber. After two hours of waiting they are granted entrance.

The Sorcerer-Baron has goats horns and slitted nostrils. He clutches in one hand the ruby staff, and a green crystal orb in the other. When he stands from his spiked throne he wavers, one of his legs beset by curses unseen. He surmises the party with great interest.

The sorcerer-baron reveals it was he who was trying to ally with the northern beastmen. He seeks the powers of chaos, a sentiment to which Icoriol the elf is vehemently opposed despite his chaotic nature. The others agree to serve Voghtairi to earn their freedom. His decree: to explore the western portion of the Nildazi Crags and report their findings. He bestows a magic charm on each of them, designed to keep track of their locations. He also bestows them a sorcerous crystal that they might communicate with him.

The party, choosing service over dungeons, depart into the mountains.
