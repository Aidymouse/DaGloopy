With Vomert suitably scared into silence, The Book of White Names continue to explore the cavern. **The Kid** falls into the river while trying to cross, leading The Book to attack and destroy the piranhas in the lake. Tying a rope secures a way across, but wets all the torches. **The Enmity's** light spell illuminates the way.

A gnawed skeleton is found on a sandy bank. Teeth marks indicate something a bit smaller than human size. **The Kid** swims through the black water to identify a gleaming object that turns out to be a conch shell. When he holds it to his ear, the sound of trickling water almost seems to create sinister words. This unsettles him, but **The Fiend** is unable to recreate the effect. 

**The Gelid's** snake familiar swims further down a flooded passage. It finds a rock-pool like monstrosity that seems to appear only when the snake lifts is head out of the water. Attempts to get closer are thwarted when the snake is destroyed, ending the connection between mage and familiar.

With their fears that worse things lurk in the cave confirmed, and their hit points running low, The Book decide to haul their giant crabs back to base camp. Magical corruptions have rendered **The Gellid** to the size of a gnome, and caused **The Fiend** to grow talons and vomit honey. They cover up their magic by blaming the maladies on the cursed cave.

When they arrive it's almost dark out. The survivors now number around 80, but supplies on the beach are not plentiful. **The Crouton** ingratiates himself with Gregor the surgeon. **The Kid** expresses concerns about The Books purpose on the island. **The Burn** responds by interrogating him about his desire to learn magic. Their conversation is hushed but gets a little too heated - an old man overhears a whisper-shouted reference to magic.

The Book find a secluded spot where they can discuss and keep their eyes out for the old man and his 3 compatriots. The next day, **The Burn** attempts to rally the camp and establish himself as a leader, but his authority is questioned. Still, a small band of 6 believers , including the strange **Gemerald**, who makes allusions to shapeshifting, and the old man, **Bunsen**, form and are tasked with finding a way atop the cliff that bears the cave. **Bunsen** refuses, insisting he come into the cave with The Book and Vomert. To avoid suspicion he his accepted, and The Book get ready for their 2nd expedition.
