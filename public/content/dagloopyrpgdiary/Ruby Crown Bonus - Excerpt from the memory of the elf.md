# Ruby Crown - Excerpt from the Memory of The Elf
_One of my players wrote up this slick summary of events from around Ruby Crown XXXI to XXXV. I admire his brevity, I wish I could write so concisely. It's reproduced here with permission._

_Excerpt from the memory of the elf_
On a cloudy day after the reclamation of Castle Denaumo, Icoriol set out on a journey. His destination: the Tower which Talari had witnessed as he rode to the villages of Desaune. With him he brought his weapons, tools and a single swift horse.
At the Tower he met a nameless Knight who asked to be called Friend - a Friend who wielded a strange rune-emblazoned greatsword and called upon echoes of alternate selves to battle alongside him. Together they delved into the Tower and fought against the animated armor that served as its guardians, and bore witness to its secrets - a strange glass sculpture which projected sunlight into scripture on the wall (unreadable on the cloudy day), and a javelin which bent sunlight into harmful beams. At the conclusion of their exploration, Icoriol extended an offer to Friend to join the Friends of Orthos.

The next two weeks were spent working hard. Talari, preparing to ascend as baron of Desaune, called upon local workers and his own arcane power to repair Castle Denaumo. Siriel and Monkey spent their time at Ord Cabare, meeting many of its varied people. Balthazar spoke to the people of Ord Cabare on the newly ascended baron. Icoriol, calling upon Enzo and Balthazar for aid, created a fine chest which perfectly preserved whatever was placed within.

During their well-earned rest, the Friends received a message from Baron Voghtairi. "Stop. I know what you are doing. There are things at play you are not aware of. We must speak. Where shall we meet?" They considered their options and determined to meet with Voghtairi and hear him out, though not without certain precautions - choosing a friendly (or at least neutral) domain to hold the meeting in, with allies at hand. All to be done once they returned to Orthos.

Additionally, the Friends (via the same magic that Voghtairi used to speak to them) commiserated with Baron Amecouth, their trusted friend. He warned them that the Llamontca Wode had been cursed, Fangmire consumed by it and the beastmen able to attack unhindered. It was clear that Fort Duvno needed help - help that the Friends might be able to provide.

The journey back to Orthos began.

Along with two traders who Monkey had befriended, they journeyed for many days and found strange things along the way. A patch of grass infused with fey essence taught Icoriol a fey trick. An encounter with some trolls and a strange aquatic foe nearly brought disaster - the creature dragged Siriel and Balthazar into the water, seeking to drag them into the depths - narrowly averted by Balthazar invoking his divine power. At last, finding familiar forests and rivers, the Friends of Orthos arrive at Fangmire where their journey once began.

Unfortunately, this was not a kind reunion. Fangmire had changed, becoming insular and suspicious. The Friends were watched warily by passer-byes, and even familiar faces scorned them - Rantusk the alchemist did not recognise them, despite having previously met Balthazar and Icoriol. After a night and a day of investigation, the cause was found - the town’s population had been replaced by doppelgangers which feasted on flesh and worked with the beastmen attacking Orthos.

Taking flight from Fangmire, the journey took a new path, a bold foray north into the Beastlands north of Orthos. The Friends journeyed by road and along river, heading north to seek a clay egg they had heard was growing in the swamps near Fangmire. They found it to be guarded by many doppelgangers and another of the clay giants that had once attacked Fort Duvno. Taking advantage of their new Friend’s bladework, they felled the giant, drove off the doppelgangers and destroyed the clay egg.

With smoke and blood at their tail, the Friends journeyed into the Beastlands, where they met a new friend. Keoth, a beastman who had barely survived a massacre, introduced himself with difficulty. He revealed that the beastmen were not a single faction, but many ‘enclaves’ of which the ones attacking Orthos were merely the most belligerent. Caskoon was their foe, along with Yokotel and other enclaves they had allied or enslaved, with neutral enclaves bearing names such as Natano and Ka’Ye. Keoth himself was of the enclave Taun Zokar, seeking allies against Caskoon - allies which he may have found in the Friends of Orthos.

The Friends headed east, through swamp and hills, finding the wide grasslands that made up the Beastlands. Upon the grassy hills were built wooden towers occupied by beastmen of Caskoon and Yokotel, and the Friends saw signs that a vast gathering of beastmen was near. Often they narrowly avoided being spotted by the lookouts of Caskoon, and their luck eventually ran out as they were spotted by a patrol of Caskoon’s hunters and their giant wasps.

In the ensuing battle, Enzo was slain and Balthazar grievously wounded, but the Friends’ blades, spells and bullets slew the beastmen and their wasps. Burying Enzo, the Friends did not stay to grieve.

On the last leg of their journey, the Friends saw the borders of the Llamontca Wode, a deep and inviting forest which they nonetheless avoided. Emerging from the forest was a patrol of soldiers, who spoke of the strange passing of time and witnessed fey creatures. The Friends invited them to join their party.

At last, after a long and arduous journey, the Friends arrived at a safe haven in the walls of Fort Duvno.
