From within the room come snarls, bangs, crashes, screeches, thwips, cracking and squelching. Then, **The Thing from the Ocean** falls backwards from the door, dead.

The rest of The Book magically pummel the snake men inside. Two die to **The Croutons** thunderwave spell. The third escapes through a window into a courtyard. The book pursue only to be met with a treacherous battlefield. A sea of writhing snakes is punctured by fallen columns and bits of stone. In the center, a giant yellow, red and white snake is bewitched by a snake-priests jade flute. The snake surges forward to its prey.

**The Fiend** produces a cloud of fog around the snake. In the confusion, **The Burn** casts a jump spell on **The Gelid** who proceeds to leap from column to column and confront the flute-playing priest. He is almost bitten in two by the giant snake, but manages to disrupt the priests concentration long enough to break the enchantment on the snake. It turns on its master.

During the fighting, someone approaches. His lithe figure is donned in crow feathers and a mask to hide his face. This new person is **Crow**, sent by **Bunsen** to keep track of The Books adventures (to ensure their safety, he says).

With the help of the newcomer, the priests is defeated and his jade flute saved from the snakes bite by **The Wardens** magic hand. The giant snake almost seems to bow in reverence before fleeing the monastery with all of the small snakes in tow.

Now free of serpents, The Book rest in the monastery and plot their route home. They attempt to go east around the swamps and onto the beach, but their passage is blocked by a river. Forced to re-route south, The Book must rest overnight in the swamp.

During the night, **The Enmity** is rudely awoken by swarming maggots - rot-grubs! The Book has good luck and none of their skins are pierced while they fend off the grubs. The rest of the night is spent restlessly but without incident.

The next morning the book complete their trek up the cliff and get to the archway leading down to the Aerie. Billowing black smoke comes up from the bottom of the cliff but it's source cannot be ascertained. The Book make their way down the treacherous steps (**The Burn**, **The Warden** and **Vomert** almost fall to their deaths but manage to be secured).

When the book get back to the camp, they find a scene of desolation. **Gregor** describes how the previous dawn, the tide had surged and dragged as many as 40 survivors toward the ocean. Then the fish men had come, laying siege to the gate. Several of their misshapen corpses are now seen throughout the cavern. Though the men fought for their lives, the camp of previously 100 souls now dwindles down near 40. And it does not seem like the fish men are going to be satisfied until all the marooned seamen are dead.
