# Saltmarsh III

The house was empty.

I'd really love to know who ransacked out hideout and burned my comrades but they must have moved along before we returned from Copperlin.

I tell a lie, the house wasn't completely empty. We found an old prisoner of ours still bound in the room we left him in. One of Julez' experiments. Our captain chose to let him go, return to his family in Saltmarsh. This is a very strange thing for our captain to have done. Runaway mouths talk, even ones that have had to deal with Julez. Our hideout is dead, but I don't need any more people out there talking about me. Once he was free he found a bed and slept. I have him my last mug of wine, mixed with some of Julez poison for good measure. Better than rotting in a cell. At least his last drink will be a pleasant one.

We found some old electrum ingots hidden in one of the rooms. The floor was collapsing under us and the very beams of the house seemed to be struggling to keep upright. We vacated before checking the attic. I hope there wasn't anything valuable up there.

The journey north was tiring (for anyone who rowed). Saltmarsh is 10 leagues north, compared to 5 to Copperlin, but we were better rested. As we rowed I mused on the strange things I had heard.

- Mining dwarves of copperlin are apparently working with drow from the south. These drow are rumored to be attempting to depose high elves.
- Sea Devils (those scaled lizard-type people) took some sort of fishing boat from or into Saltmarsh

Perplexing times, but nothing that sounds like a stable line of work. Sett is very clear that that's our next move.

We pulled into Saltmarsh port in our tiny ship ready to be laughed at. The mighty crew of the sea ghost reduced to rabble in a row boat. Something strange was waiting for us though. The Sea-Ghost was sitting in port. Beaten, battered, barely seaworthy, but floating. We inquired with a dock hand as we secured our boat.

"The sea ghost was claimed by mighty heros! Bassdon,Saveen and Turis were their names, lizard people. They went diving and found you're old boat. Now they're off to the marshes, lookin' for someone called Galen Primewater."

This is unsettling news. Firstly, I don't want filthy sea-beasts claiming our rightful home. Secondly, whatever golden creature stole our ship promptly discarded it at the bottom of the sea. Why? I am still partly convinced the sea witch has something to do with it, but honestly she seems as clueless as the rest of us.

Back home there were monks that would chant at your door, promising spiritual fulfillment if you would come with them. A few times I saw men seemingly lured from their homes by the chants. I watched the flowers and grass quiver at the sound of the monks voice. The strange way that nature obeyed those echoing hymns. Monks are easy to deal with. You can hear them coming from a mile away, then you shove a rag or a blade in their mouth and they go home.

The sea-witch does not chant, so I do not know what to do with her. I'm beginning to think Sett may be right about her not summoning the strange beast. I'm not sure which I prefer.

We headed to The Empty Nest, an old tavern and one of our favorite haunts. The room smells like piss and the ale tastes of fish but there is some quality in the feeling of home.

Kreb the inn keep scowled as we entered. already getting our mugs ready. He knows he's in for a long night, but at least he'll be paid. Sett and I approached the bar. Sett pulled one of the electrum ingots from his pack.

"Drinks are on me tonight, innkeep. Once you've taken off the drink how much time will whats left get me with Sally Brown." He raised his eyebrows, Kreb continued pouring drinks without looking at him. "You know you don't have enough, Sett."

"Oh Kreb you know I've got plenty." now the innkeep turned to look at us. He slammed a drink down, spilling half of it on the counter. "Come now, where is sally brown anyway?"

"What, you haven't stopped by your mothers cottage yet?"

Setts smile dissipated. The room felt suddenly colder. He grabbed the innkeeps wrist, glared into his eyes.

"Insult me or my crew as you like, Kreb, but you'd do best to leave out my mother."

Kreb is a strong man, but Sett's sudden increase in intensity surprised him. Before he could respond, Sett released his grip and walked away. Kreb looked at me, I replied with a shrug.

Skylar was talking to Captain Zendross. Red skinned, with devil's horns, Zendross is something called a tiefling and an old contact of ours. She deals in magical items, but her prices are usually far too high. I suppose her choice for career was limited. As usual she didn't have anything we could afford, but she and skylar hit it off. He's a charmer, that one. Too cheerful for his own good.

Later in the night, after all of us had had too much to drink, we decided enough was enough. We had to figure out what has happening to our boat. Out in our small rowboat, we snuck aboard the wreckage of the sea ghost.

Everything was gone. Whoever found our boat had absconded with our cargo before coming to port. They even found my secret cache of weapons. Everything emptied out.

I can respect the work of seaborn thief, but I should be furious. And usually I would be, but something else is lodged in my head.

On the middle deck, behind the rotted door leading to the sea-witches former chamber, a man lay dead on the floor. The skin was pale, cold. I have smelled dead men before, but this was horrific, like the bottom of the sea had vomited all the dead fish and drowned sailors it had ever swallowed. This, though, was of minor concern compared with the unfortunate seaman's cause of death. His neck had swollen and popped. His head was missing, the body lay headless in a pool of dried gore and bile. Whatever happened here happened while we were fighting the crew and losing our boat to a monster.

Perhaps the sea-witch didn't summon the strange golden beast. But she definitely did this.
