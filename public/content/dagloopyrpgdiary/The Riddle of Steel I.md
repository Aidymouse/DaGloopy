These 7 wizards leave from their homeland of Loribel aboard the 20 ships headed for Kalar, the new continent. A new age of sorcery dawns today.

After 8 months at sea, danger strikes. A horrid storm rolls in too fast to be anything of nature. The Book awaken to screams, cries, and the thunderous cracking of masts. They escape the shipwreck by binding several barrels together with **The Gelid**'s power to instantly freeze water. Though nearly dashes across the rocks, they finally make their way to shore just as dawn breaks.

A long beach stretches as far as the eye can see to the north and south. The only adornment of the empty ocean is a pyrimidial rock some miles out. Their boats have been completely swallowed. To the east, thick jungle blankets rolling hills and adorn the top of a mile-high cliff. The dark mouth of a cave peers over the treetops. A wide but shallow stream runs from the forest in the direction of the cave.

The Book pick up the survivors Fadder, Perty and Vomert (much to **The Burn**s chagrin - more mouths to feed) picking through the wreckage on the shore and make their way to the cave for want of shelter. There they find the medic Greg tending to a doomed captain. A small group of survivors inhabit the mouth of the cave but none are healthy enough to ensure the cave is free of dangers. The Book offer to help (and claim the treasures within before anyone else can).

The presence of survivors is a difficulty to the wizards. They resolve to not use magic unless they must. If the survivors find out about the presence of 7 magicians after being shipwrecked by a supernatural storm, the consequences could be dire.

The stream widens until it takes up most of the cave, and soon The Book encounter a cliff they must climb. **The Kid**, a trained athlete, surmounts the rocky face and a knotted rope allows the rest to follow him through a passage. There's a quick run in with some piranhas in the stream when The Warden slips on some moss, but **The Gelid**'s ice powers ensure no one is hurt.

Now far into the cave, the sound of a distant waterfall has risen considerably. In a large cave **The Kid** and **The Enmity** (both dwarves) study a pile of rubble. They determine that the stone was once worked, though it is now shattered. After their study, giant crabs emerge! **The Warden** halves the threat with a careful sleep spell, and the rest are hacked apart by battle axes and elemental spells. Vomert tagged along with the group and is intimidated into silence by **The Burn**.

"If you tell any what you have seen, the spirits of fire will burn out your eyes."
