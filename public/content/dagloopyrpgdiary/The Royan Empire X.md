# The Royan Empire X

The expeditioners have three gaian at swordpoint. They are beaten, but they are not silent. They yell at their captors.

"*Ayatsuka*, there are more of us, and we are coming for you."

"Alanhoran waits for you in the temple!"

After much deliberating, (and **Millicent** briefly making one of the Gaian sick with divine plague) the expeditioners decide the let the gaian go. They flee into the woods.

With **Zornāns** severed head, **Edwina** thinks of a plan. She wants to bring it to the grey necromantic pillar to hear what it can tell them. Their map shows that there should be a pillar to the north, though they have not visited it. In searching, **Teala** leads the group off the trail and they come to the river where they find a giant stone bridge. The bridge is in ruins, but mostly traversable, and a giant tower is built up on the other side. The expeditioners cross the bridge to the only major break, which must be jumped.

When **Prold** jumps, he hears a strange laughter echoing from the river. As more of the expeditioners gear up to make the jump, **Prold** spots the source of the laughter. A troll sneaking up from behind! As the fight breaks out, another troll climbs out on Prold's side, and a third slithers out from below as well.

The fighting is harsh, but the expeditioners have learned from their last troll encounter and this time brought Alchemist fire. A troll knocks **Prold** into the water, but he recovers and climbs back up to deliver several heavy blows. The troll, ignited by alchemists fire, burns to ash under the barrage.

On the other side of the bridge, **Maddox** defends against two trolls with his steel shield while **Panowin** slips between their legs, dealing precise blows. The fight is about even, **Teala** and **Edwina** bolstering their allies, but full decided when **Millicent** arrives with her blood flaming sword.

After the trolls are burned down to ash, **Prold** congratulates **Millicent**. "That flaming sword came in handy."

**Millicent** ponders the blood red flames as they dissapear. "That wasn't me."

"What?" **Prold** is confused.

**Millicent** turns to look at her orc companion. "I didn't do that."
