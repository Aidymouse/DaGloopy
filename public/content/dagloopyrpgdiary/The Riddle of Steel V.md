_I was away in Perth for session 4._

A funeral is held for **The Kid**, who is laid to rest ...

**The Burn** churns over the threat of suspicious seamen while gazing out from The Aerie. He sees colorful flashes of what can only be magic. He scowls.

The next morning, he meets the rest of The Book, who inform him of their escapades: shortly after the burial, their group of scouts returned from their expedition up the cliff. Though they found their way up the cliff, **Plink** and **Roger** had been slain by harpies and they turned back. As the group neared the shore, strange dog-like creatures with taut skin and vines for tails had attacked. The Book had fought these off. They had also encountered a chained wooden coffin washed up on the beach. Opening it, they met a wild incoherent man / creature they dubbed **The Thing from the Ocean**, who tags along with The Book. 

**The Burn** gives a small lecture on the proper time and place to use magic, but ultimately agrees that their loyal followers would need to know sooner or later. The Book is approached by **Bunsen**, though it is unclear if he was eavesdropping or not. **Bunsen** chastises the book for sneaking out with their own group and not disclaiming their intentions to the rest of the camp. He is rudely rebuffed by **The Burn**, who reminds him that an offer for help was extended to the entire camp.

**Vomert** is growing wearier with The Book, but **The Gelid** assures him that not all of them are power-hungry and murderous. This calms him somewhat, but not very much.

The Book decide to explore for a route up the cliff themselves, departing that morning.

Day 1: The book head southwest along the beach and find the slope where the cliff meets the land. The climb most of the way to the top. The clifftop is blanketed in heavy jungle, but The Book opt to stay between the cliff edge and the canopy.

Day 2: Journeying along the cliff, The Book find a stone archway next to the cliff. This connects with the treacherous cliffside stairs from The Aerie. **The Enmity** also uncovers a ruined stone path leading from the archway into the jungle. The high vantage point also reveals a swamp to the north. The Book venture into the jungle, following the path, though it is quickly consumed by vegetation. That night, they rest in a hollow tree log and are attacked by an Iron Cobra! The snake deals paralytic bites to **The Gelid** and **The Thing from the Ocean** but is ultimately defeated without casualties. The strange being is made of hollow metal, evidently animated by some kind of magic.

Day 3: Continuing northwest through the Jungle, The Book finds more of the path they had been following earlier. It leads north to a clearing with a crumbling monastery. The monastery has an unnaturally large snake presence (including a well with a writhing snake mass at the bottom). The Book find defaced religious idols, crushed stone heads replaced with snake skulls of alarming size. They also find a room with healing supplies (requested by the surgeon **Gregor**). **The Enmity** narrowly avoids a sound-making floorboard trap. In the room beyond, whispered hissing is heard but quickly goes silent. **The Crouton** tells **The Thing from the Ocean** to charge through the door and attack. He does not take much convincing.
