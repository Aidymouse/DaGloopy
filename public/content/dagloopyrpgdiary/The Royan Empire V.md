# The Royan Empire V

Surrounded by deafening buzzing, The Expeditioners fight toe to toe with three swarms of giant mosquitos. **Teala**'s spell may harm some of her party members, but it clears the terrain greatly, letting **Prawn** get into position. Unfortunately, her heal spell also hits the mosquitos. **Millicent** hid in a patch of ferns while **Prold** had trouble attacking with his glaive. Eventually the expeditioners decide that fighting from within cover is a better idea, and destroy the swarms from range. After the bleeding is staunched, the rainforest falls back to eery silence. Little did they know that the mosquitos carry Pyrexic Maleria, and several of them have been affected.

The journey home is interrupted by the discovery of a manmade grey quartz pillar. It's shrouded in clumps of moss and twigs leant against it. It also shows signs of wear, scratches from sharp implements. It seems innocuous, except that a small bird with it's head mostly off is perched atop. The bird behaves in a way that outright contradicts its mortal injury - hopping and fluttering like normal. When **Edwina** approaches it, it flies off, but after crossing some invisible threshold the bird falls out of the sky, stone dead. **Maddox** draws parallel to "a stone that raises the sleeping" from a religious tale involving the enigmatic Epi, who saw the stars. **Edwina** realises through bardic knowledge that this pillar should not be touched with bare skin. The nonplussed expeditioners continue home, reaching Kuljak after one more night in the forest.

The expeditioners have little to say about their expedition, but learn from Harim that The Blades of Beth have not returned (despite leaving before the expeditioners). Thankfully, they return after two days, just in time to witness **Teala**, **Maddox**, **Prawn** and **Edwina** fall ill. To the learned medics of Kuljak, it is clearly maleria. **Teala** and **Maddox** recover quickly, but **Edwina**'s condition worsens dramatically. Her cares to the wind, she goes to **Governor Gashesh** and demands, by right of her noble birth, access to the best healer in Kuljak. The governor starts making arrangements, but is interrupted by Magister Oregati, who pledges his own **Edet Leej** as her personal healer. **Millicent** by her side, **Edet** and delirious **Edwina** discuss the necromantic pillars (the gaian draw power from themwhen they are damaged), the innate intelligence of the Gaian ("they can be quick-witted, and some are even tactical. But smart like you and I? No. I don't think so." says Edet), and a rumor about a strange man buying horses. 

**Millicent** calls through the woods for **Zornān**, hoping to get some information about the pillars, but gets **Cavorta Katil**, the ranger of The Blades of Beth. They exchange awkward pleasantries, neither being one for conversation.

**Edwina** recovers slowly, but poor **Prawn**, who was forgotten in all the rush, succumbs to his illness. **Edet** breaks the news. **Millicent** anoints his body but does not attend the burning of his body and the spreading of his ashes into the Kulurātil.

The company regroups at The Expeditioners hall, wondering about their next moves. The Blades of Beth have told them that a colossal mosquito now guards the river north. They also found another grey quartz pillar to the north. Oregati's lieutenant **Salvan Kwandi** marches in an definitely tears down the governors message about revolting peasants, stating it "will not entertain the foolishness of men hiding in the woods."

**Edwina** and **Maddox**, with many questions to ponder, decide to visit the archives. As they leave The Expeditionary Hall, a dishevelled figure bursts into the room. It is **Shintulra Vina**, a minor expeditioner. He wears many scrapes and a forests worth of mud on his face. He is driven my a malignant energy, a crazed look in his eye. He spots, then points at, **Edet Leej**. "You!" he cries as he rushes up to him, grabbing him by the shirt. "Leave me to die in the forest, will you? I'll show-" he is cut off as Edet's companion **Sirifa Kaivar** tackles him to the ground. The stress proves too much for him, and he collapses. **Harim** puts him to bed, noting a high fever.
