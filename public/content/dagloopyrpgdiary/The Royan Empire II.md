# Royan Empire II

The Expeditioners are resting in the Expeditioners hall. **Harim Pochani**, laden with boxes and log books, gives them two small potency charms - gem-like clasps that affix to their weapons (and give them +1 to hit and damage). He also directs them to the stockpile where the elderly **Dov** sorts through items scavenged from the rainforest as well as equipment that belonged to now-fallen Expeditioners. He and **Prold** bond over orcish living - Dov lived with orcs as a child - as he peruses the gear. Some gleaming armor that lets you see in the dark, an axe with a human skull affixed to the handle, a blood charm (giving another damage die to weapons) and, three potions of various effects and a spell scroll writ in human skin. None are purchased, for the Expeditioners are short on funds! They gear up with mundane gear acquired from Kuljak bustling market. **Edwina** overhears two shopgoers discussing a strange robed figure, maybe a priest, or perhaps an ancient ineffable being disguised, that stares at the statues over Shatrya's Pass.

Meanwhile, **Mr Gurgle Golorok** endears himself to **Kitabaya** by acting strange, then challenging her to a duel. Which he loses, but not badly. This serves to make her like him more, and she shares that she found her Vaatru beyond the statue of Teosh Rishkar just north of the forest.

The Expeditioners do some minor intelligence gathering at the shared map table inside the Expeditioners Hall, but find it rather lacking in detail.

And they're off! Into the woods, on foot, searching for... Who knows what? Current goal: something about Gaian.

And Gaian they find. When they stop at the crumbling statue of Teosh Rishkar (of which only two claws and great rubble remain) **Prold** identifies two sets of tracks leading through the woods. One heads north, the other northeast, in the direction of a giant tree seen over the horizon. **Edwina** and **Prold** put their heads together and identify the northeastern tracks as Gaian made, and a few days old. They follow these.

Two sluggish, blisteringly hot days later, The Expeditioners arrive at a towering 60' tree. They spot figures standing amongst a tangled platform in some high branches. When **Millicent** comes forward to greet them, **B.S.P** notices one silently raise a bow! It's Gaian! This time aided by some minor tree spirits called Twig jacks. The Expeditioners take a beating but put down the gaian, Twig jacks, and a gaian mage, then set to exploring the tree.

An upper room contains a piece of bark like parchment which shows, of all things, a map of Kuljak with various spots marked off. They also seem to have acquired some strange thjngs for Gaian to have - an armor stand and metal helmet, a smithed wooden shield, and a lockbox with 200 royan royals, broken open by **Maddox**. Further up some iron-eating red lichen damages **Prolds** weapon and disguises a secret door found by **Millicent**. Beyond it are more Gaian! The remnants of those slain.

Attempts to parley are denied - the gaian are in a panic and start firing before listening, and maybe Millicent's "this fight ends now" translates as "it's the end for you" in Gaian tongue. Determined to figure out what the Gaian are doing here, The Expeditioners resolve to try to end the conflict without bloodshed.
