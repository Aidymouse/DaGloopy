I've been running rime of the Frostmaiden in 5e for friends of mine. Thought it would be cool to keep a log of what's happening. I wonder if blogger has good tools to organize these articles so they can stay out of the way. I'll check later.

We ran through the first half of the book (up to the dragon), then took a break so my boi Theo could run us through descent into Avernus (that adventure fucking SUCKS!). During that time there was an in universe time skip of 8 months, during which some players had downtime adventures over discord. This first post is about those adventures leading up to part 2 of icewind dale.

Part two of the adventure sucks ass, so I added a bunch of crap using principles of node based design and old school style sandboxing. I might do some posts about the enemy factions at some point I think, but for now you can read through it all in order as the players experience it.
 
My first few posts will be fiction that recaps the events of everyones downtime adventures, and then i'll go into the sessions. To test my writing skills i'll try to dramatise it. Make it a bit interesting. Not like anyones reading anyway :^)

## The Characters
This part always bores the shit outta me in other campaign diaries so I'll keep it short. We have 8 (fucking eight!) players coming back in part two. They are detailed thus:

**Clovis Bray** young tiefling son of one of the noble houses of Targos. After outing naerth maxildanarrs betrayal in his cooperation with the duergar to build the chardalyn dragon, he took his place as speaker of Targos, cementing himself as the richest man in icewind dale.

**Kimbo** Clovis' adopted sister. Journeyed with him for most of her life, split off after the dragon attack.

**Stranvei** a fishman with touches of divine power. Seeks redemption from his god, mistress moon.

**Moonwhisper** Shadar-kai. Has some strange connection to the dale, keeps getting deja vu, but she's never been here before, has she?

**Ember** birdman obsessed with fire. Draws warlock powers from the spirits behind the flame

**Ire Youngmark** a young assassin from House Jirukel of Targos. One of Clovis' secret biggest enemies, but currently journeys with him. Her mind may be starting to change.

**Sorville** Deilha retired soldier hiding from his past in icewind dale. Likes simple things, but his past refuses to stay distant.

**Bargron** is a dwarf with mechanical wolf. He never stays in one place for too long, and never shows his face.

## Background

When the dragon attacked ten towns it was an attack in two parts. It's breath of light and heat scorched towns, burned men. It's secondary breath was plague. Far more insidious. When a band of mysterious wannabe heroes destroyed the dragon (I heard it blew up, levelled half the town hall!), the light and heat went away. The plague stayed.

Dragon plague. Works its way into your veins. Makes you cold and weak. Eventually, it takes your heart, and you die.
