# The Royan Empire I

After two weeks of bureaucratic waiting, **Millicent**, **Edwina**, **Teala** and **B.S.P** meet with **Prold**, **Maddox** and **Mr Gurgle Golorok**. The Royan steward of Ijaj, **Abernathy**, was flabbergasted to be told he would not be journeying to Kuljak. **Zornān**, hungover from his recent acquaintance with ale, follows from a distance.

On the blisteringly hot road the expeditioners crossed a mile-long stone bridge over a chasm. Just one of countless stone ruins from an age beyond remembering. In the jungle on the other side, a tree falls right in their path, which then swarms with two giant snakes! It's an ambush! The nobles **Millicent** pissed off have been waiting for revenge, but they've underestimated the Royan Expeditionary Force. **Teala** blasts most of them with a blight spell, killing 4 of 6 instantly, including the 4th son of Lord Smeald (a minor nobleman, it turns out).

While cleaning up the giant snakes, a cry is heard from the bushes. **Mr Gurgle Golorok** pierces the jungle and spots the predator - a giant mechanical leopard! It leaps forward, killing the bull pulling their cart and bathing it's jaw in blood, then running off into the woods. A second mechanical creature, if you count the elephant buried in the ground.

Kuljak is big and busy. The expeditioners meet with **Governer Gashesh**, the ruler of this place who is dealing with many problems including an uncommonly high rate of expeditioners being killed in the jungle. The expeditioners settle into the Expeditionary hall and get acquainted with **Harim Pochani**, the gentle giant who runs the hall, **Ebina Kulkawam**, a loner and local gossip (whom **Mr Gurgle Golorok** trades rumors) and **Kitabaya**, who shows off by parading a Vaatru's severed head around. She seems to have fans.

### Rumors Learned
- The hills of this place hide powerful stones. Blue, but like glass.

### Guildhall Notices
- Be weary, Griffons nesting in the northern cliffs
- Vaatru respond well to gifts of food
- Gaian spotted 2 days ago around 10 miles east of Kuljak
