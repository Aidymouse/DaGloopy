# Ruby Crown I

We open on the road to Fangmire, a town clinging to the Prioro Marsh in the northwestern corner of The Ruby Crown: the domain of The Concubine Queen and capital of Orthos the great kingdom of jewels

An elderly man walks beside a dishevelled drunk. The elder is Clement, cleric of Baron Paul the imminent. The younger is Lobsang, drunken monk

A whistle sounds behind them - bandits! They are chased up the road to the gates of Fangmire. From adjacent roads they are joined by Gruffie, a half-foot druid; Icoriol, an elf(!); and Castamir, a devil-man from the desert

Backed into the corner, Clement earns the ire of the guards by thunderwaving one off his horse. Before they can respond, the guards on the walls blow up a bandits head with an arbeques (it's renaissance times) and the party is saved, safely making it inside.

After a quick stop at the temple (where a rumor is gathered), everyone meets in The Frog and Toad for a drink. After hearing about the gathering forces of chaos in some nearby caves (stay tuned), a noble herald enters the building. He is from Solemnity - the capital.

"By royal proclamation! The Marquee Iona Pyxis Anaein hereby promises a sum of 5,000 gold pieces to any who find her nephew, Baronson Hael Pyxis Quoth, who has disappeared in the swamps of Prioro Marsh."

"5000 gold pieces? Hardly a sum we can pass up!" says Lobsang. The others agree. After getting a map from the local alchemist, they head north into the marsh.

Their first obstacle is an old bridge covered in webs. A keen eye spots a thicker portion of webbing in the center - a way for the giant spiders living under the bridge to find prey. Gruffie uses her druid magic to talk to the giant spiders. They're only interested in fresh meat

After conquering the bridge with rope, they follow some directions from a bird and come across a catacomb entrance in the swamp. The darkness beckons.

Descending into the depths, the group finds two sleeping frog-men in front of a door. Fearful of creaking hinges, they take a passage on the right instead.

Beyond two strange crawling moss creatures is a collapsing passage. Luckily, they squeeze through without much trouble.

A giant orchid, fed by light streaming in through holes in the ceiling, contains a delicious sap. Gruffie Mayhem realises (after Lobsang has had a taste) that this substance is highly attractive to beasts, and causes delayed vomiting if ingested by humans.

Up a further passage the group come to a door. Many toad-men lurk beyond in a room with a faded fresco of the wilderness and a pool of water. While debating what to do, Gruffie pushes her way past into the room. The group braces for combat.

But the frogs seem to think Gruffie is one of them (A lucky reaction roll). They offer her moss, for to them she looks pale and sickly.

Continuing further, the group passes a class coffin with a man laying inside and finds the domain of the frog king, who demands tribute lest he slay them for their trespass. Initial offerings (some coins) go well, until Lobsang vomits all over the floor before the king.

"Transgression!" Croaks the frog king, "Not worthy of court... But perhaps... The transgression can be forgiven if the crown can be retrieved... From the snake!"

The Snakes a big statue. It almost takes Lobsangs hand when he grabs the grown from it's articulated jaw. Panels open, letting swarms of snakes into the room. The battle is fierce, Icoriol fall unconscious from venom, but the snakes are defeated; the crown won.

With the return of the crown, the frog king deems the party friends of the frogs, and they are given free reign of the catacomb.

The glass coffin bears a riddle "Beyond the veil of leaves, in the five fingered room, proof of the lord's devotion shall unseal his tomb. After some thought, Castamir has the answer: The faded fresco!

Finding a secret lever in the moss of the ceiling, a section of the wall swings open, leading to a room with five columns and five inches, each with a coffin. The columns are painted with the same man and woman in different ages, first as children, then split apart by war, only to be reunited, having a child of their own. However, the drawings are out of order.

Lobsang correctly guesses that the proof of the lord's devotion means the 4th niche - the ring finger. Within are 5 buttons, corresponding to the five pillars. There are a few attempts at an order, unsuccessful. While the monk and the elf play, Gruffie opens up a different coffin.

A shadow leaks out, taking humanoid form. It grabs gruffie by the head and she feels the cold stillness of undeath. Just in time, the correct sequence is pressed and the shadow dissapears into smoke.

The glass coffin unsealed, the group collect their winnings - 200 crystal beads, a silver crown, and a magic cutlass with a lion handle. After giving the crown to the frog king, they learn of monster who buy and sell people in the south. The frog king has friends down there, and entrusts a young frog knight tonthe party - proof of the frog kings trust.

The group has found treasure, but the nephew remains missing. Leaving the cave, the group prepare to head south.
