Elial has angelic power The Friends have not seen before, like setting people on fire with his eyes. His ghouls are starving and so vicious but they fall with relative ease. Elial is finally put down with a critical bullet from Siriel. Balthazar catches The Sceptre of Languard as it falls.

Like an electric shock, Balthazars mind suddenly reels. Memories of the greater divine consciousness fill him. He sees Elials banishment from heaven, hears voices deep and loud saying muffled things he cannot make out. The celestial ring script on the sceptre reads:

- The coment of Ephesus shall touch the earth
- From the open gates come the riders of Neng
- Antithesis of heaven will be known and struck down
- The will of heaven will be known
- A great disconnect in the realms of men. The pasts link shattered
- A great re-awakening of the beast left sleeping, a sacrifice of blood
- Heaven will fall silent for half of one hour

More divine riddles! What could they mean?

When The Friends emerge from the tombs they are met by The Lawful Council which congratulates them on their success (with a knowing look to Balthazar). There in the holiest site in all Orthos, the oldest church of the nation, Balthazar becomes the fifth member of The Lawful Council. They tell him to announce his victory to the people of Solemnity, especially his worshippers in The Prolegomenon.

Outside the crowd of zealouts is watched by several Black Rose Knights. Balthazar steps into their midst with the sceptre and spreads his wings as he hoists the sceptre. The prophecy fulfilled, the crowd goes wild with cheers and sobs. They move towards the angel, to lay their hands on him, but the knights get nervous at their energy. They start barking orders, raising shields. As the situation suddenly begins to boil, a rock is thrown and smacks a captain squarely in the side of the helmet.

Friend quickly wades into the crowd, coverging with the knight captain who is pushing people out of his way as he strides towards his assailant.

The knight wants to arrest the man, but the prolegomenon look ready for a fight. Friend urges caution to the raging knight. But cool heads prevail, and the knight storms off with the rest of his men. There is no riot through the streets of Solemnity. Balthazar departs the crowd into the sky.

The rest of the session was spent doddering around the city, I think there was a rest and some downtime. Over the week Icoriol crafted, Friend fought in the fighting pits (where he is coming to make quite a name for himself), Monkey caroused and Balthazar loomed. Siriel talked more with Razor, trying to get details from him, but he is still put off by a recently broken leg and mental torture at the hands of Monkey. Still, she persists, and there is something he cant help but find quite charming about the devil.

With the benefit of hindsight it seems so stupid that there weren't more threads going about in the city. I was so focused on trying to find a way of generating game material that I neglected to actual pull on any strings that are so evident now. Thieves guild turf war with Razor, fighting pit drama with Friends, an interesting development while carousing or crafting, it would have been so easy to slip in some hooks but I completely missed the trees for the forest it seems.
