The Book head back into the cave.

**The Kid** surmounts the cliff across the river, but an earthquake shakes the suspended log loose creating a natural bridge. This is good because old man Bunsen does not seem keen on swimming.

The Book explore the left passage this time, swimming across the stream, and come to a dead end with a gently flowing whirlpool. Within is a bag of gold (another level!), a corpse and a giant octopus! It grapples **The Enmity** but is quickly slain by the rest of the book. Bunsen is left on the other side of the river, so cannot observe them casting spells.

The Book return to the passage they last explored with **The Gelid**s snake familiar. This time they swim across themselves (leaving Bunsen behind) and come to the rock pools they observed before. A monstrous slime-sea-creature lurks in the room, but it's shadowy movement is spotted by **The Gelid**, then the creature is located by **The Burn**s dagger and a catapult spell. **The Warden** almost succumbs to the beasts DEATH GAZE but they all make it out alive. After the fight, **The Kid** scales the northern rock outcropping and finds a magic green eye attached to a stick and a passage forward through worked stone.

The Book follow the passage and come to the top of the passage they observed previously from below amidst the rubble. While searching for secret doors, **The Kid** accidentally knocks some rubble into the opening but it does not fall! The bridge is invisible! The Book safely cross.

The next chamber is flooded with sunlight from a natural opening in the cliff edge. The Book find themselves 600 feet above the forest floor in a room that stinks of rotten meat.  A giant table covered in old rotted carcasses and the presence of bird nests betray the presence of some flying fiend which is soon revealed to be three Harpies! Their luring song fails to guide anyone over the cliff (though Vomert does come close) but their claws and clubs do put an end to **The Kid**, the first casualty.

So ends the tale of one of The Book of White Names. But the cave is now clear. Far in the distance mysterious storm clouds gather over a sharp knife of rock jutting from the sea. The mystery of Kalar is only beginning.
